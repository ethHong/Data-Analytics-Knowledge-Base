## Overview

**ðŸ’¡How do we measure *pure* effect of treatment?**

![ab_regression_summary](../images/ab_regression_summary.png)

* Best way to measure effect of treatment (marketing event, new feature etc) is **running randomized A/B Test**
* This is because, if assignment of treatment is ***not randomized***, difference in result could be effected by other variables (bias) other than the treatment.
* [Linear regression coefficient](Linear Regression and Coefficient.md) is used to measure pure effect of treatments.
  * Why?: ***Coefficient of treatment vaiable*** implies the effect of treatment on dependent variable (*y*), fixing all the other variables constant.

## Basic Framework Structure

![regression_summary](../images/regression_summary.png)

* Methodology: Run regression on variable of interest ($y$) over treatment dummy variable $X_1$:
  $$
  Sales = y = \beta_0 + \beta_1*\text{(Ad exposure dummy)}+ e
  $$

  * In the example above, $X_1$ = 1 if the user is exposed to the ad, 0 if they are not exposed to the ad.
  * **Interpretation of $\beta_1$:** Effect of 'Ad exposure' on increasing value of the sales. (How likely the sales will increase, when user is exposed to the ad?)
  * **Interpretation of $\beta_0$:** Baseline expected sales, when user is not exposed to the ad. (When Ad exposure dummy = 0)

### Problem

* Only relying on single variate regression, only using treatment dummy is both risky for using data from A/B test, and using data from observational data.
* This is because of  [Omitted Variable Bias](Omitted Variable Bias.md). 
  * When the data is not from perfectly randomized A/B test, we should utilize techniques as [Control Variables](Using Control Variables.md) : To control [Omitted Variable Bias](Omitted Variable Bias.md) - external factors that both impact treatment assignment and dependent variable (y)

* If we don't know how treatments are assigned (what potential bias exists in treatment assignments), we can use methods like 
  * [Diff-in-diff](Difference in Difference.md) using panel data, to see if the change in trend is due to the treatment itself.
  * [Instrument Variables](Instrument Variable.md) : To control reverse causality, or external factors that influence treatment, buy not on the  dependent variable (y)
