# Difference in Difference

**category_specifier** : "Causal Inference"

**Reference Docs: [Fixed Effect](Fixed Effect.md)

## **Motivation**

**ðŸ’¡How can we estimate causal effects when we donâ€™t have an experiment?**
**What if both treated and control groups are changing over time?** 

## **When Does Diff-in-Diff Apply?**

- When there is a **policy, treatment, or event** that occurs at a **specific time**, affecting only some units.
- You observe **two groups** (treated vs. control) **before and after** the intervention.
- You suspect **both groups would have followed similar trends** if the treatment had not occurred.

## **What is Diff-in-Diff?**

**Difference-in-Differences** is a quasi-experimental method that estimates **causal effects** by measuring how outcomes change over time between a **treated group** and a **control group**.

The method accounts for both **time-invariant differences** between groups and **common trends** that affect both groups, thereby isolating the treatment's impact.

$$ \text{DiD Estimate} = (Y_{\text{treated, after}} - Y_{\text{treated, before}}) - (Y_{\text{control, after}} - Y_{\text{control, before}}) $$

## **Why It Matters**

Diff-in-Diff is a powerful method to make **credible causal claims without randomization**. It allows us to account for:

- **Baseline differences** between treated and control groups
- **Time trends** that affect both groups equally

This technique is widely used in policy analysis, economics, and business to evaluate the **real impact of changes** in the absence of experiments.

## **How to Apply or Extend Diff-in-Diff**

Here are several ways to implement and strengthen DiD analysis:

- **Parallel Trends Check**: Visualize pre-treatment trends to justify the core assumption.
- **DiD Regression Model**: Estimate with interaction terms in a regression:

$$ Y_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Treated}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Post}_t + \beta_3 \cdot (\text{Treated}_i \times \text{Post}_t) + \epsilon_{it} $$

- $\beta_3$  is the **DiD estimator**
- **Two-Way Fixed Effects**: Control for unit and time fixed effects in panel settings.
- **Event Study Designs**: Examine dynamic treatment effects over multiple periods.
- **Placebo Tests**: Apply DiD on fake treatment dates or untreated units to test robustness.

## **Examples**

- **Soda tax introduced** in one city â†’ compare beverage sales before and after with a nearby city.
- **Company stops advertising** on one platform â†’ compare click-through rates (CTR) over time with another platform.
- **State raises minimum wage** â†’ compare employment changes with a neighboring state that didnâ€™t.

## **Key Assumptions**

- **Parallel Trends**: In the absence of treatment, the treated and control groups would have followed similar outcome trends.
- **No Spillovers**: The treatment does not affect the control group.
- **No Other Confounding Events**: Nothing else happened at the same time that only affected the treated group.

## **Key Equations**

**DiD Regression Model**:

$$ Y_{it} = \alpha + \beta_1 \cdot \text{Treated}_i + \beta_2 \cdot \text{Post}_t + \beta_3 (\text{Treated}_i \times \text{Post}_t) + \epsilon_{it} $$

- $\beta_3$ gives the **causal effect** of the treatment.
