## Standard Error

* From sample statistics, $\sigma$, the population STD is unknown.
* Standard Error is an estimation of Standard Deviation
* Small Standard Error implies estimation is likey to be more accurate.

## Standard Error of Mean Estimator $\bar{Y}$

$$
\sigma_{\bar{Y}} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}} \approx s_{\bar{Y}}= \frac{s_{Y}}{\sqrt{n}}
$$

### Takeaways

1. If we have a lower standard error, it means our prediction is likely more accurate.
2. To achieve a smaller standard error, we need a larger ***N*** (sample size), but
3. There are limitations if the **"Standard Deviation (or variance) of the population itself"** is large.
